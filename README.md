## Technologies Used

The project is built using the MERN stack, which consists of the following technologies:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and manage user information, chat messages, and other relevant data.

- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that handles server-side logic and API routes.

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the client-side of the application.

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development and running the Express.js server.

- Socket.IO: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and the clients, facilitating instant messaging.

- SCSS: A CSS preprocessor that provides additional features and enhancements to standard CSS, such as variables, nesting, and modular organization.

- Docker: Docker is a software platform used to develop, ship, and run applications within lightweight containers, essentially packaging software into standardized units that include everything needed to run.
